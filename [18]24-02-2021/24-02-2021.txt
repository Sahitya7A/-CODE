You are given a sequence A of N integers: A1,A2,A3... AN.

You would like to make all elements in A different. To do so, you may perform operations 
of two types:

Remove an element. The cost of this operation is X coins.
Decrease the value of an element by one. The cost is Y coins.
You may perform as many operations as you wish.
It is possible and allowed that some elements will become negative
(after you decrease an element multiple times).

Your task is to find the minimum number of coins you would need in order to 
make A pairwise distinct.

Input Format
------------
The first line contains three space-separated integers N, X, and Y 
		— the size of the sequence and costs of operations.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,A3...AN
		— the initial sequence.

Output Format
-------------
Print one integer — the minimum number of coins needed to make A pairwise distinct.



Sample Input :
6 10 3
5 2 5 3 5 2

Sample Output :
16

Explanation :
we are given a sequence of size n=6.
The cost of removing and decreasing by one are 10 and 3 respectively.

The initial sequence is (5 2 5 3 5 2).
One optimal strategy is:

Remove one of three fives, e.g. the middle one. The remaining sequence is (5 2 3 5 2).
Decrease the second element by one, to get (5 1 3 5 2).
Decrease the first element by one, to get (4 1 3 5 2).
This way, you need to spend 10+3+3 =16 coins. 
The resulting sequence(4 1 3 5 2) is indeed pairwise distinct.


Sundar works in a farm which belongs to Vikas 

On the occasion Sundar's Birthday,Vikas planned to give a gift to Sundar. 

Vikas offered all the fruits that Sundar can collects in one go from the right side of the farm returning back to the same side, 
such that he can take exactly 2 left turns. 

Sundar can start plucking from any cell A[i][N] where 1 <=i <= N. 
The farm is represented as a 2D matrix, each cell consisting of some units of fruit.

Sundar wants to collect as much amount of fruits as possible,
but he is illiterate, so he needs your help to get more fruits.

Please refer to the image below for more clarification on how to traverse the farm. 

Input Format
------------
first line consists of 2 space separated integers N and M, 
denoting the dimension of the farm.
The next N lines consist of M space separated integers 
each denoting the amount of dragon fruit in the cell.

Output Format
-------------
Output a single integer denoting the maximum amount of fruit Sundar could collect.

Sample-1:
Input =
3 3
1 2 3
3 3 1
4 1 6
Output = 20

Explanation:
		1<-2<-3
		|
		3 3 1
		|
		4->1->6
    Sundar starts from "3" and takes 1st left turn at "1" and takes 2nd left turn at "4" and reaches "6".
    so, the number of fruits he collects is 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 6 = 20



Sample-2:
Input:
3 3
3 7 4
1 9 6
1 7 7
Output:
34
    
Explanation:
		3 7<-4
		   |
		1 9 6
		   |
		1 7->7
Sundar starts from "4" and takes 1st left turn at "7" and takes 
2nd left turn at "7" and reaches "7".
so, the number of fruits he collects is 4 + 7 + 9 + 7 + 7 = 34
