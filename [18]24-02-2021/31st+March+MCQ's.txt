3) Give the worst case time complexity for below linked list operations 

A) Insert after node
B) Delete after node
C) push
D) Append











Ans-A

addHead, removeHead, and retrieveHead are all O(1) 
(This is because we just need to reference, de-reference or access one pointer which happens in contant time)

addTail and retrieveTail are O(n). If the Singly linked list implementation has a tail reference then the time complexity will be O(1).

removeTail is O(n) (This is because we need to traverse to the second-last node so that its reference can be reset to NULL).

Operations to access an item by position (add , retrieve, remove, replace) are O(n). 
(This is because we need to traverse the whole linked list in the worst case)

Operations to access an item by its value (find, remove) are O(n).
(This is because we need to traverse the whole linked list in the worst case)

4) Given the language L-{bac,caa,ab,b} , which of the following strings are in L* ?
