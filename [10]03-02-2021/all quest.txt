Your playing a game, the game contains r*c array.
Each cell in the array represent an health score.
You can move one step either downwads or rightwards only.
Whenever you visit a cell in array, you will lose the same health score of the cell.

You will start at (0,0) of the array and have to reach (r-1)*(c-1) of the array.
Your task is to minimize the loss of overall health score.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two integers R and C.
Next R lines: C space separated integers, health points in each row of the grid.

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, minimal loss of overall healthscore.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
3 3
1 3 1
1 5 1
4 2 1

Sample Output-1:
----------------
7

Explanation:
------------
start at cell(0,0) =>  1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the loss of healthscore.


Sample Input-2:
---------------
4 4
8 6 9 3
7 6 2 1
5 5 7 9
8 9 6 2

Sample Output-2:
----------------
34

Explanation:
------------
start at cell(0,0) =>  8→6→6→2→1→9→2 minimizes the loss of healthscore.

You are given a sequence A of N integers: A1,A2,A3... AN.

You would like to make all elements in A different. To do so, you may perform operations 
of two types:

Remove an element. The cost of this operation is X coins.
Decrease the value of an element by one. The cost is Y coins.
You may perform as many operations as you wish.
It is possible and allowed that some elements will become negative
(after you decrease an element multiple times).

Your task is to find the minimum number of coins you would need in order to 
make A pairwise distinct.

Input Format
------------
The first line contains three space-separated integers N, X, and Y 
		— the size of the sequence and costs of operations.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,A3...AN
		— the initial sequence.

Output Format
-------------
Print one integer — the minimum number of coins needed to make A pairwise distinct.



Sample Input :
6 10 3
5 2 5 3 5 2

Sample Output :
16

Explanation :
we are given a sequence of size n=6.
The cost of removing and decreasing by one are 10 and 3 respectively.

The initial sequence is (5 2 5 3 5 2).
One optimal strategy is:

Remove one of three fives, e.g. the middle one. The remaining sequence is (5 2 3 5 2).
Decrease the second element by one, to get (5 1 3 5 2).
Decrease the first element by one, to get (4 1 3 5 2).
This way, you need to spend 10+3+3 =16 coins. 
The resulting sequence(4 1 3 5 2) is indeed pairwise distinct.

There are set of people standing in row with Male and Female, where male candidates are represented
with 0 and Female with 1. We are given any random number ‘R’ such that ‘R’ values of males need to
be replaced with female at certain positions in such a way that we form longest female continuous
group given in a row.

Your task is to help to form the longest female continuous
group method in the row and print the length of it.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two integers N and R, number of people and R.
Line-2: N space separated integers, [0, 1] only.

Output Format:
--------------
Print the length of longest female group.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
10 3
1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0

Sample Output-1:
----------------
7

Sample Input-2:
---------------
14 2
1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0

Sample Output-2:
----------------
11
