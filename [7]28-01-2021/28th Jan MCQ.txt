Consider the C function given below. 

Assume that the array listA contains n (> 0) elements, sorted in ascending order.

int ProcessArray(int *listA, int x, int n) 
{ 
    int i, j, k; 
    i = 0; 
    j = n-1; 
    do
    { 
        k = (i+j)/2; 
        if (x <= listA[k]) 
            j = k-1; 
        if (listA[k] <= x) 
            i = k+1; 
    } 
    while (i <= j); 
    if (listA[k] == x) 
        return(k); 
    else
        return -1; 
} 

Which one of the following statements about the function ProcessArray is CORRECT?

(A) It will run into an infinite loop when x is not in listA.
(B) It is an implementation of binary search.
(C) It will always find the maximum element in listA.
(D) It will return −1 even when x is present in listA.


Answer: (B)

What does the following function print for n = 25?

void fun(int n) 
{ 
  if (n == 0) 
    return; 
  
  printf("%d", n%2); 
  fun(n/2); 
}   

(A) 11001
(B) 10011
(C) 11111
(D) 00000


Answer: (B)

What is the return value of following function for arr[] = {9, 12, 2, 11, 2, 2, 10, 9, 12, 10, 9, 11, 2} and n is size of this array.

int fun(int arr[], int n) 
{ 
    int x = arr[0]; 
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) 
        x = x ^ arr[i]; 
    return x; 
} 

(A) 0
(B) 9
(C) 12
(D) 2


Answer: (B)

Explanation: Note that 9 is the only element with odd occurrences, all other elements have even occurrences.

If the input array has all elements with even occurrences except one, then the function returns the only element with odd occurrences. 
Note that XORing an element with itself results 0 and XOR of 0 with a number x is equal to x.

Consider a sorted array of n numbers. 
What would be the time complexity of the best known algorithm to find a pair ‘a’ and ‘b’ such that |a-b| = k , k being a positive integer.

(A) O(n)
(B) O(n log n)
(C) O(n ^ 2)
(D) O(log n)


Answer: (A)


Explanation: 
Just maintain two pointers at the start and accordingly increment one of them depending upon whether difference is less than or greater than k. 
Just a single pass is required so the answer is O(n).



5)Which of the following sorting algorithms in its typical implementation gives best performance when applied on an array 
which is sorted or almost sorted (maximum 1 or two elements are misplaced).


(A) Quick Sort
(B) Heap Sort
(C) Merge Sort
(D) Insertion Sort


Answer: (D)

Explanation: Insertion sort takes linear time when input array is sorted or almost sorted (maximum 1 or 2 elements are misplaced).

Consider empty Stacks S1 (Size = 4) and S2 (Size = 5) and a  Queue Q1 (Size=5), 
perform the below given operations on S1 and Q1 alternatively and PUSH the POPed/Dequeued elements from S1  and Q1 to S2.

Stack Operations				Queue Operations
1. Push L M A B					1. Enqueue P L Q S
2. POP 2 elements				2. Enqueue Y
3. PEEK()						3. Dequeue until FRONT = 4

what will be the output of POPed elements of 'S2' until S2 is empty.

A) B A P L Q S
B)  S Q L P A B
C)  Q L PA B
D) B A L Q S Y

Answer: C

Explanation: when we pop()  2 times from S1, the elements are B and A, will be pushed in S2.
Then Dequeue() until front=4 gives P L Q S which will be pushed on S2. But size of S2 is 5. So it takes only P L Q.
So S2 contains (from top)  Q L P A B.

If one uses straight two-way merge sort algorithm to sort the following elements in ascending order 20, 47, 15, 8, 9, 4, 40, 30, 12, 17
then the order of these elements after the second pass of the algorithm is:

(A) 8, 9, 15, 20, 47, 4, 12, 17, 30, 40
(B) 8, 15, 20, 47, 4, 9, 30, 40, 12, 17
(C) 15, 20, 47, 4, 8, 9, 12, 30, 40, 17
(D) 4, 8, 9, 15, 20, 47, 12, 17, 30, 40


Answer: (B)

Explanation: In first pass the elements are sorted in n/4 (first 2 elements in each group) sub arrays but in second pass the elements are 
sorted in n/2 (first 4 elements in each group) sub arrays.



8)class Main { 
 public static void main(String args[]){ 
   final int i; 
   i = 20; 
   System.out.println(i); 
 } 
} 

(A) 20
(B) Compiler Error
(C) 0
(D) Garbage value


Answer: (A)




9)Predict the output of the following program.

abstract class demo
{
    public int a;
    demo()
    {
        a = 10;
    }
 
    abstract public void set();
     
    abstract final public void get();
 
}
 
class Test extends demo
{
 
    public void set(int a)
    {
        this.a = a;
    }
 
    final public void get()
    {
        System.out.println("a = " + a);
    }
 
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Test obj = new Test();
        obj.set(20);
        obj.get();
    }
}

A) a = 10
B) a = 20
C) Compilation error
D) None of these


Ans- C


10)A relational database contains two tables student and department in which 

student table has columns  roll_no, name and dept_id and 
department table has columns dept_id and dept_name. 

The following insert statements were executed successfully to populate the empty tables:

Insert into department values (1, 'Mathematics')
Insert into department values (2, 'Physics')
Insert into student values (l, 'Navin', 1)
Insert into student values (2, 'Mukesh', 2)
Insert into student values (3, 'Gita', 1) 

How many rows and columns will be retrieved by the following SQL statement?

Select * from student, department

(A) 0 row and 4 columns
(B) 3 rows and 4 columns
(C) 3 rows and 5 columns
(D) 6 rows and 5 columns


Explanation: Simple,Cartesian product of two tables will result

Rows = 3*2 = 6 
Columns = 3+2 = 5 

Option (D) is correct.
