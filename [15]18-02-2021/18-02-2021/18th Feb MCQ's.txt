#include <stdio.h> 
int main(void) 
{ 
    int val = 'dd'; 
    printf("%d",val); 
    return 0; 
} 


A) 100100
B) 200
C) 25700
D) Compilation fails


Ans-C

100 is ASCII value of character ‘d’.

Let us consider below line

int val = 'dd' 

(%d, a) prints 25700 as output
01100100 01100100 (Binary of 100 100)
Assuming int is of 2 bytes, starting byte is occupied by first character ‘d’ and second byte by second character ‘d’.
Therefore overall binary involves 0110010001100100 i.e 2^14 + 2^13 + 2^10 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^2 = 25700.
