Leela wants to win every time. 
She will be given a pair of Integers(a,b), Which are Positive Prime numbers. 

A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors 
other than 1 and itself.

-Their absolute difference is exactly equal to  2     [|b-a|=2].

She will be given a range of integers (i,j) Both Inclusive 
Help Leela find such pairs which are in the range(i,j)

Note that pairs (a,b) and (b,a) are considered to be the same pair.

Print 0 if no such pairs exists

Sample Test Case
input = 3 13
output = 3

Explanation1:
There are three pairs of twins: (3,5),(5,7) and (11,13).

Ramesh is given a task to find the 
number of valid brackets for a given length 'n'

input = 2
output = 1 

Explanation 
There is only possible valid brackets of length 2, "[]"

input = 4
output = 2 

Explanation 
Possible valid brakets of length 4 are "[[]]" and "[][]" 

input = 6
output = 5

Explanation 
Possible valid brackets are [[[]]], [][[]], [][][], [[]][] and [[][]]


input = 1
output = 0

Explanation 
Possible valid expressions with legth 1 is 0.

If input(n<0) print 0
