*/
write a program to print the characters of a string based on frequency

input = abcabbaaad
output = aaaaabbbcd 

if two or more characters have the same frequency then print the order they occur in the string 
Assume the input consists of only Lower and Upper Case Alphabets(A-Z/a-z)


input = abcd
output =abcd

input = aabcAbbb
output = bbbbaacA

input =  abababab
output = aaaabbbb

input = abcdabcd
output = aabbccdd

assume the input string contains only lower and upper case characters
