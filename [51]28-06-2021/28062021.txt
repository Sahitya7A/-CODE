


You will be given two different groups of elements. 

Create two linked list and merge them in the ascending order 

Assume the two different groups will be in ascending order 

input = 2 5 10 12
3 4 8 15 20
output = 2 3 4 5 8 10 12 15 20

input = 1 2 3 4
6 7 8 9
output = 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9

input = 8 9 10 11
1 2 3 4 
output = 1 2 3 4 8 9 10 11



create a linked list of given elements 

after creating break th e list into two different lists where the 
first list contains all the positive numbers and second list contains the negative numbers


input =1 2 3 -5 6 -7 -8
output = 1 2 3 6
-5 -7 -8

input =1 2 3 4 -5 -6 -3 -2 9 
output =1 2 3 4 9
-5 -6 -3 -2


/*
create a linked list of given elements 

after creating break th e list into two different lists where the 
first list contains all the positive numbers and second list contains the negative numbers


input = 7
1 2 3 -5 6 -7 -8
output = 1 2 3 6
-5 -7 -8

input = 9
1 2 3 4 -5 -6 -3 -2 9 
output =1 2 3 4 9
-5 -6 -3 -2


The first line of input contains the size of linked list followed by list elements 


While breaking the list you are not supposed to create a new node.
